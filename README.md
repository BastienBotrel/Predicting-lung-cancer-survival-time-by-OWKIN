## About me
I worked as a biostatistician during 7 years in contract reasearch organization and biotechnologie, in France, United Kingdom and Belgium.
I am seeking to move into data science and especially in artificial intelligence.

I participated to this challenge to have a first project in data science. Furthermore, it was a way to combine my knowledge in biostatistics and my new skills in machine learning and deep learning.

## Project Overview

The aim of the challenge is to predict the survival time of a patient (remaining days to live) from one three-dimensional CT scan (grayscale image) and a set of pre-extracted quantitative imaging features, as well as clinical data.
