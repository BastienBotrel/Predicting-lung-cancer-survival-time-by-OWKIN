# Predicting lung cancer survival time by OWKIN

Challenge provided by OWKIN's company and organized by College de France and Ecole Normale Sup√©rieure of Paris.

**Ranking: 2/98** 

## About me
I worked as a biostatistician during 7 years in contract reasearch organization and biotechnologie, in France, United Kingdom and Belgium.
I am seeking to move into data science and especially in artificial intelligence.

I participated to this challenge to have a first project in data science. Furthermore, it was a way to combine my knowledge in biostatistics and my new skills in machine learning and deep learning.

## Project Overview

### Objective

The aim of the challenge was to predict the survival time of a patient (remaining days to live) from one three-dimensional CT scan (grayscale image) and a set of pre-extracted quantitative imaging features, as well as clinical data.

### Context and Resources

 3 Types of data were available for this challenge:
 * Clinical data (6 variables)
 * Radiomics features (53 quantitatives features per patient, extracted from the scan)
 * 3D images (one scan and one mask per patient)

Detailed information on the context of the challenge and data can be found [here](https://challengedata.ens.fr/participants/challenges/33/) on the website of the challenges (https://challengedata.ens.fr/).

### Sample size

300 patients were included in the training set. 
The test set was splitted into two subsets: 63 patients in a public test set used to evaluate the model and 62 patients in a private test set used for the final ranking.

## Data Exploration and Cleaning

## Model Building

First of all, I performed a survival analysis using a **proportional hazard model** (Cox model), based on clinical data and radiomics features. I used this model as a *baseline model* to the deep learning models I tried afterwards. This model contains 6 variables (3 clinical and 3 radiomics features) significant at 5% threshold.

Then, I used the 3D CT scans in a **Survival Convolutional Neural Network** (SCNN) trained with a loss function specific to survival analysis (Cox PH loss function [1]). The SCNN output a risk score for each patient, which is then integrated in a Cox model on top of the clinical data previously retained in the reference model.

I tried two others CNN trained with the same loss function:
* **Survival Convolutional Neural Network** from **2D CT scans** in order to increase the sample size of the train data (3D CT scans have been cut at the center of the tumor in each axis)
* **Clinical Survival Convolutional Neural Network** combining the 3D CT scans with the clinical/radiomics features

## Results

The metric used to evaluate the model was the concordance index (C-index), a score ranging from 0 to 1.

The best model is the Cox model integrating the risk score predicted from the **SCNN using the 3D CT scans**, with a C-index of 0.77.
