## About me
I worked as a biostatistician during 7 years in contract reasearch organization and biotechnologie, in France, United Kingdom and Belgium.
I am seeking to move into data science and especially in artificial intelligence.

I participated to this challenge to have a first project in data science. Furthermore, it was a way to combine my knowledge in biostatistics and my new skills in machine learning and deep learning.

## Project Overview

### Objective

The aim of the challenge was to predict the survival time of a patient (remaining days to live) from one three-dimensional CT scan (grayscale image) and a set of pre-extracted quantitative imaging features, as well as clinical data.

### Context and Resources

 3 Types of data were available for this challenge:
 * Clinical data (6 variables)
 * Radiomics features (53 quantitatives features per patient, extracted from the scan)
 * 3D images (one scan and one mask per patient)

Detailed information on the context of the challenge and data can be found [here](https://challengedata.ens.fr/participants/challenges/33/) on the website of the challenges (https://challengedata.ens.fr/).

### Sample size

300 patients were included in the training set. 
The test set was splitted into two subsets: 63 patients in a public test set used to assess our model and 62 patients in a private test set used for the final ranking.
